# The Harry Potter Project

This website uses a Harry Potter API (Basic URL: https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/) that provides a basic information about Characters and Spells from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!

The website has two pages: one of the characters and one for the spells. The Page for Characters has a search box where you can type the name of a HP character to find basic info about them like, their full name, their species, their Houses (if they are affiliated to one of the House of Hogwarts), the name of the actor that plays them and finding out if the character is a wizard or not.

The Page for Spells has a dropbox that shows all the spells that were used (or mentioned) in the movies and their effects. If you pick one of the Unforgivable Curses (*Avada Kedavra*, *Crucio*, *Imperio*) an alert window should appear.

## So what are some of the features of each pages?

### Character Page

The Character page gives you some quick info about the HP character. The search box requires that you put the characters name to get that information. Depending on which house the character belongs to, the font color will change. If available, you can see a picture of the character. It is unfortunate that not all characters have an available image. There is a link, when you hover over it, will increase the size (and change the color) of the text and will bring you to the Spell page.

### Spell Page

The Spell page gives you some quick info about specific spells. Since it might be difficult to remember the name of a specific spell, I thought it would be preferable to have the list of spells in a dropbox, that way the user can pick the specific spell he wants information about. There is a link, when you hover over it, will increase the size (and change the color) of the text and will bring you to the Character page.
