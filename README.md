# The Harry Potter Project

This website uses a Harry Potter API (Basic URL: https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/) that provides a basic information about Characters and Spells from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!

The website has two pages: one of the characters and one for the spells. The Page for Characters has a search box where you can type the name of a HP character to find basic info about them like, their full name, their species, their Houses (if they are affiliated to one of the House of Hogwarts), the name of the actor that plays them and finding out if the character is a wizard or not.

The Page for Spells has a dropbox that shows all the spells that were used (or mentioned) in the movies and their effect. If you pick one of the Unforgivable Curses (*Avada Kedavra*, *Crucio*, *Imperio*)
